# workplaceAttritionModeling
A classification project centered around workplace attrition

This is a project done as part of the Supervised Learning section of my Chegg Data Science certification.

It takes a dataset found at kaggle (details in jupyter and ppt files) and looks ot create classication models aimed at detecting what factors affect workplace attrition and to see if accurate predictions can be made aboout which employees will leave a company.
